# ecommerce-site

## Vision

Our e-commerce website is dedicated to offering a diverse range of Shrek-themed merchandise,
including T-shirts, pants, toys, shoes, socks, and more. The platform is designed to accommodate
two distinct user classes: customers and admins. Admins will benefit from an administrative
dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of incoming orders, outgoing shipments, and
other essential statistics.
The website will encompass standard e-commerce functionalities, such as a search function, product
filtering, and dedicated product category pages. While ensuring a seamless user experience is
important, our primary focus for this project lies in optimizing the backend infrastructure, aligning
with the assignmentâ€™s main priority.
